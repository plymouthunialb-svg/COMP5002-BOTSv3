# COMP5002 – Assignment 2: BOTSv3 Incident Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains my work for COMP5002 Assignment 2, which focuses on investigating
a simulated cyber security incident using the Boss of the SOC v3 (BOTSv3) dataset.
The analysis is conducted using Splunk to explore logs related to email, endpoint,
and network-based attacks within a simulated organisation.

The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate practical SOC investigation skills,
including log analysis, incident detection, and incident response, following
professional security operations practices.

## SOC Context and Incident Handling
This investigation is approached from the perspective of a Security Operations Centre (SOC).
The SOC is responsible for monitoring, detecting, analysing, and responding to security incidents.

SOC activities relevant to this investigation include:
- Initial detection of suspicious events
- Analysis and validation of alerts
- Incident escalation and response
- Post-incident review and improvement

Further analysis and reflections will be expanded as the investigation progresses.

## Environment Setup (In Progress)
Splunk Enterprise will be used as the primary analysis platform.
The BOTSv3 dataset will be ingested into Splunk following the official Splunk documentation.

Planned steps:
- Install Splunk Enterprise
- Download BOTSv3 dataset
- Ingest logs into Splunk
- Validate data sources and indexes

Screenshots and configuration details will be added in later commits.

## Guided Investigation Questions (Pending)
The BOTSv3 guided questions provided on the DLE will be answered using Splunk SPL queries.
Each answer will include:
- The SPL query used
- Screenshots of query results
- A short explanation of findings

This section will be completed incrementally.

## Conclusion (To be completed)
A final summary of findings, lessons learned, and SOC improvement recommendations
will be added after completing the investigation.
